In particular, read the documentation on [Normal distributions](https://dlsun.github.io/symbulate/common_continuous.html#normal), the [standardize method](https://dlsun.github.io/symbulate/rv.html#standardize), and the [`**` (exponentiation) notation](https://dlsun.github.io/symbulate/probspace.html#Independent-probability-spaces) for drawing multiple values independently from a distribution. **You should Symbulate commands whenever possible.**  If you find yourself writing long blocks of Python code, you are probably doing something wrong.  For example, you should not need to write any `for` loops.\n",
